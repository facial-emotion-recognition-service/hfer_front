# Human Facial Emotion Recognition (HFER)

## Introduction
HFER is a Python project that leverages a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to detect emotions from human faces which are extracted from images uploaded by the user. This streamlit front-end allows a user to upload an image and get an annotated image back with face highlighted. The emotions of these faces are then returned and displayed in tabular form.
